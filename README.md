# Baby Essentials Hub

Baby Essentials Hub is a modern React + Vite storefront that showcases curated baby and kids products with a refined shadcn-ui driven interface. The project ships with static sample data, a polished shopping cart, and responsive layouts so you can focus on brand storytelling instead of wiring up APIs.

## Tech Stack

- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite 5
- Tailwind CSS & shadcn-ui components
- Zustand for cart state
- Sonner + Radix UI primitives for UX polish

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd baby-essentials-hub-main
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server runs at `http://localhost:5173` by default (or the port shown in your terminal).

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the local dev server with hot reload
- `npm run build` – bundle the production build
- `npm run preview` – serve the production build locally
- `npm run lint` – run ESLint across the project

## Customization Tips

- Product data lives in `src/data/products.ts`. Edit or extend this list to reflect your catalog, swap images, and tweak descriptions.
- UI logic for listing products is in `src/components/ProductGrid.tsx`, while product detail views live in `src/pages/ProductDetail.tsx`.
- Tailwind tokens and global styles can be updated via `tailwind.config.ts` and `src/index.css`.

## Deployment

Any static hosting provider (Vercel, Netlify, Render, Cloudflare Pages, etc.) can serve the production build generated by `npm run build`. Upload the contents of the `dist` folder and map your preferred domain.
